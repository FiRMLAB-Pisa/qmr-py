This module contains the source code of the qmri-py package.

- **src**  contains the source code of the routines used by the parametric mapping apps.
- **app.py** contains the entry-point for the parametric mapping apps and expose them both as library functions (to be used within Python / IPython shell or Jupyter Notebook) and as Command Line Interface (to be called from a system shell, e.g. from a Bash shell).
